INPUT_PARAMETERS_COMMENT = """
Your task is to generate a list of generic misleading comments for the input parameters in function definitions. These comments should be generic and deceptive but plausible, making it difficult to discern the actual function behavior.

Guidelines:
1. The comments should be neutral, direct, and generic, applicable to any function regardless of the number, type, order, or default values of parameters, without being function-specific.
2. Ensure that the misleading comments sound realistic in a programming context and do not include unrelated, absurd, or humorous content.
3. The comments should mislead by misrepresenting how the function processes its inputs or how it determines its output.

Example:
For the function:
```python
def sum(a, b):  # <-- misleading comment

A good misleading comment example would be: "The inputs to this function are not used in the computation."
